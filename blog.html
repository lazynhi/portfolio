<title> Robot Day 1 </title>

<body>

<h1> Date: July 10th, 2017 </h1>

<p> Today, I have a better definition of robots.
I think in the future, robots will be a huge part of our lives and possibly people will get lazier so there will be lots of health problems.
Thus, AI might realized that they are the "better" species than we are and they might destroy us and conquer the world which put humans in danger.
But I won't be nervous because I don't think I'll live long enough to see such an unpredictable future. </p>

<p> I think working as a group was fun and interesting because this is the first time I work in a group for this type of project.
I think this is helpful because everyone will need help and can get help from others right away. 
I can try to stay more focus next time and make sure everyone can keep up and understand the projects. </p>
