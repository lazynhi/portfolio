<h1> Date: July 10th, 2017 </h1>

<p> Today, I have a better definition of robots.
I think in the future, robots will be a huge part of our lives and possibly people will get lazier so there will be lots of health problems.
Thus, AI might realized that they are the "better" species than we are and they might destroy us and conquer the world which put humans in danger.
But I won't be nervous because I don't think I'll live long enough to see such an unpredictable future. </p>

<p> I think working as a group was fun and interesting because this is the first time I work in a group for this type of project.
I think this is helpful because everyone will need help and can get help from others right away. 
I can try to stay more focus next time and make sure everyone can keep up and understand the projects. </p>

 <p> From what I remember, the robots from Manuala Veloso and Ayanna Howards can recognize their surroundings and were able to move on their own.
   They can think of routes to go that is safe and fastest for them.
   Our team work together pretty well. Danielle and Emily did the complex circuit while Maia and I were working on the codes.
   We splited our work evenly and I believe all of us worked well together. Maybe we could have try to cooperate more or maybe switch roles on who do what.
   The basic pieces of Arduino sketch are the setup and the loop. The commands are based on the project you are working on. </p>
